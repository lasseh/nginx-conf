# =============================================================================
# NGINX STATUS MONITORING ENDPOINT
# =============================================================================
# Provides basic nginx statistics for monitoring and health checks
# Restricted to localhost for security

# Use exact location match for better performance and security
# Why: Prevents matching of /nginx-status-anything or /nginx-status/path
# Impact: More secure and efficient than regex matching
# Security: Exact match prevents path traversal attempts
location = /nginx-status {
	# Enable nginx status module (modern syntax - no argument needed)
	# Why: Provides essential metrics for monitoring systems
	# Output: Active connections, accepts, handled, requests, reading, writing, waiting
	# Modern: Simplified syntax since nginx 1.7.5 (no "on" argument needed)
	stub_status;
	
	# Disable access logging for status endpoint
	# Why: Reduces log noise from frequent health checks
	# Impact: Improves performance and reduces disk I/O
	# Monitoring: Status checks shouldn't clutter access logs
	access_log off;
	
	# Allow access from localhost IPv4
	# Why: Monitoring systems typically run on the same server
	# Security: Restricts access to local processes only
	# Usage: curl http://localhost/nginx-status
	allow 127.0.0.1;
	
	# Allow access from localhost IPv6
	# Why: Supports IPv6-enabled monitoring systems
	# Modern: Essential for dual-stack network configurations
	# Compatibility: Ensures monitoring works with IPv6-only setups
	allow ::1;
	
	# Allow access from private network ranges (optional - uncomment if needed)
	# Why: Enables monitoring from other servers in private networks
	# Security: Still restricts access to private IP ranges only
	# Usage: Uncomment these lines if monitoring from other internal servers
	# allow 10.0.0.0/8;        # Private Class A
	# allow 172.16.0.0/12;     # Private Class B  
	# allow 192.168.0.0/16;    # Private Class C
	
	# Deny all other access
	# Why: Default deny policy for security
	# Impact: Blocks external access to sensitive server metrics
	# Security: Prevents information disclosure to unauthorized clients
	deny all;
	
	# Set appropriate content type for monitoring tools
	# Why: Helps monitoring systems parse the response correctly
	# Impact: Better integration with monitoring and alerting systems
	# Standard: Plain text format is the nginx default for stub_status
	add_header Content-Type text/plain;
	
	# Add security headers even for status endpoint
	# Why: Maintains security posture across all endpoints
	# Impact: Prevents potential security issues with status page
	# Defense: Security in depth approach
	add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
	add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
