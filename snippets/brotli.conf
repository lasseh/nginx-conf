# Brotli Compression Configuration
# 
# Brotli is a modern compression algorithm developed by Google that provides:
# - 15-25% better compression ratios than gzip
# - Faster decompression on client devices
# - Better performance for text-based content (HTML, CSS, JS, JSON)
# - Native support in all modern browsers (Chrome 50+, Firefox 44+, Safari 14+)
#
# Performance Benefits:
# - Reduces bandwidth usage by 15-25% compared to gzip
# - Faster page load times, especially on mobile networks
# - Lower server bandwidth costs
# - Improved Core Web Vitals scores (LCP, CLS)
#
# Requirements:
# - nginx compiled with ngx_brotli module
# - Install: apt-get install nginx-module-brotli (Ubuntu/Debian)
# - Load module: load_module modules/ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so;
#
# Fallback: nginx automatically falls back to gzip if brotli is unavailable
