# =============================================================================
# NGINX CORE SECURITY CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Essential security settings applied globally across all server blocks
# For additional security headers, include snippets/security-headers.conf in server blocks

# =============================================================================
# SERVER TOKEN SECURITY
# =============================================================================

# Hide nginx version information in error pages and response headers
# Why: Prevents attackers from knowing exact nginx version for targeted exploits
# Impact: Reduces information disclosure and attack surface
# Security: Essential for production environments
# Note: server_tokens is configured in main nginx.conf

# =============================================================================
# REQUEST SIZE LIMITS
# =============================================================================

# Limit maximum client request body size to prevent DoS attacks
# Why: Prevents large file upload attacks that could exhaust disk space
# Impact: Protects against resource exhaustion attacks
# Adjust: Based on your application's legitimate file upload needs
# Note: client_max_body_size is configured in main nginx.conf (16M)

# Limit client request header size to prevent buffer overflow attacks
# Why: Prevents oversized header attacks and memory exhaustion
# Impact: Protects against header-based DoS attacks
# Default: 1k is sufficient for most applications
client_header_buffer_size 1k;

# Limit number and size of large client headers
# Why: Prevents clients from sending excessive headers to exhaust memory
# Impact: Protects against header flooding attacks
# Format: number size (e.g., 4 8k = 4 buffers of 8k each)
large_client_header_buffers 4 8k;

# =============================================================================
# FILE ACCESS PROTECTION
# =============================================================================

# File access restrictions are configured in snippets/deny-files.conf
# Include this snippet in server blocks to deny access to:
# - Hidden files (except .well-known for ACME challenges)
# - Backup and temporary files
# - Version control directories
# - Configuration files
# Usage: include snippets/deny-files.conf;





# =============================================================================
# PROTOCOL SECURITY
# =============================================================================

# HTTP method filtering is configured in snippets/method-filter.conf
# Include this snippet in server blocks to restrict HTTP methods:
# include snippets/method-filter.conf;
# Why: Reduces attack surface by blocking potentially dangerous methods
# Impact: Prevents TRACE, DELETE, PUT attacks while allowing standard methods

# =============================================================================
# BUFFER OVERFLOW PROTECTION
# =============================================================================

# Set buffer size for client request body
# Why: Prevents memory exhaustion from large request bodies
# Impact: Limits memory usage per connection for request processing
# Balance: Large enough for legitimate requests, small enough to prevent abuse
client_body_buffer_size 128k;

# Timeout for reading client request body
# Timeout configurations are managed in conf.d/performance.conf
# These settings protect against slowloris-style attacks:
# - client_body_timeout: Limits time waiting for request body data
# - client_header_timeout: Limits time waiting for complete headers
# - send_timeout: Limits time waiting for client to accept response

# =============================================================================
# ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES
# =============================================================================

# Limit server name hash bucket size to prevent hash collision attacks
# Why: Prevents attackers from crafting server names to cause hash collisions
# Impact: Protects against server name-based DoS attacks
# Default: Usually sufficient, increase only if you have many server names
server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;

# Disable automatic index generation for directories without index files
# Why: Prevents directory listing that could expose sensitive files
# Impact: Returns 403 instead of showing directory contents
# Security: Prevents information disclosure through directory browsing
autoindex off;
